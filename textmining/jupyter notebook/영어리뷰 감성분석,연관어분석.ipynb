       " 'Visited here for Teppanyaki dinner. Spent $450 AUD for 2 people on dinner and 3 drinks. Beef quality was superb, and Teppanyaki chef was brilliant. Wait staff service however, were pushy and intrusive trying to snatch plates before they were finished on two occasions. Manager in a suit made her presence known by sweeping past the back of the table at the end of dessert, 1.5 hours into the slot. Come ask us how our meal was and if it was okay if you want, but felt like it was a “push on and leave time is running out”. If the slot is 2 hours tell us that at the start so customer expectations are clear. We are both pretty big eaters, and Food portions were FAR too large. We ordered 200gram steak with a prawn, and the steak size that we got must of been 300gm. One of the veggie set options was just plain veggie sticks with two dipping sauces. When we said at the end there was too much food, the Waiter said that 1 set is prob best for 2 people, well that’s what we expect the wait staff taking our order to explain to us if we are ordering too much - that’s their job to know the menu and explain. There is no proper desert menu! The desert consisted of either plain green tea ice cream scoop or a piece of green melon cut on its own. Can you believe that? Back home in Australia for $450 for 2 people you eat at Nobu or Minimishima and eat quality food in the correct portions, don’t leave overfull and having wasted food, and get a proper hand made desert. Things in Thailand are cheaper - me spending what I spend back home on a fine dining meal in Thailand is like me spending $1000 AUD on a dinner back home. The head chef needs to review the portion sizes and trial the sets on average people to see how much they eat. Im paying for quality, not quantity. A top restaurant shouldn’t leave customers over comfortably full, and should have a proper hand made desert menu.

       " '정말 끔찍한 점심식사였습니다 eatigo 사이트를 통해 13:30분으로 예약 후 방문했고, 데판야끼 시그니처 세트메뉴 2인분을 주문했습니다. 요리사는 저희 포함 2팀을 담당했고, 저희 첫번째 요리인 타이거 새우는 20분을 기다린 13:50분에 서빙되었습니다. 그 후 30분 이상을 기다리고 14:30분경 2번째 요리인 돼지고기 스테이크를 제공받았습니다. 매니저는 14:30분 점심 마감시간이라며 추가주문을 저에게 요청했고, 저는 아직 주문한 요리를 서빙받지도 못했다고 말했습니다. 요리사는 제 요리는 서빙하지 않고 옆 테이블의 태국인과 이야기를 하며 추가주문을 계속 요리해주었습니다. 요리사는 마감 시간이 다가오고 태국인이 팁을 주고 나가자 저에게 나머지 돼지고기 스테이크, 와규스테이크, 볶음밥을 모두 한번에 요리해주고 서빙을 끝냈습니다. 한번에 그 많은 양의 음식을 마감시간안에 먹지도 못했고, 식사 중간에 빈 시간이 많아 상당히 지루하고 끔찍한 점심식사였습니다. 다시는 방문하지 않을 것입니다.  만일 제가 eatigo 사이트에서 예약 후 할인타임에 방문하지 않았다면 이렇게 끔찍한 대접을 받지 않았을지도 모르겠네요.  It was a terrible lunch. I visited the eatigo site after booking at 13:30 and ordered two menus for the Teppanyaki signature set. The chef was in charge of our team of 2, and our first dish, Tiger Prawn, served at 13:50, which waited 20 minutes. After that, I waited more than 30 minutes and received a second dish of pork steak around 14:30. The manager told me it was time for a lunch break at 14:30 and he asked me for an extra order and said that I have not been served the dish I ordered yet. The chef will not serve my dish I talked to the Thai people in the next table and continued cooking additional orders. The cook approached the deadline, and the Thai person gave me a tip and cooked me the rest of the pork steak, wagyu steak, and fried rice all at once. I did not eat that much food at one time in the deadline, It was a terrible lunch. I will not visit again.  I would not have been so horrible if I did not visit the eatigo site after a reservation and had a discounted time.',\n",

       " \"I came here several times with my friends. The first time was so impressive as I was lucky enough to get the best Chef at Nami. I only know this after I came here many times after that. I don't know her name but she looks more senior than other people. Chef here are pretty young. She was so cheerful, professional and her skills are amazing.  I recommend pumpkin soup; Salmon is great, crispy beautifully burned outside, soft and juicy inside; steak is amazing, soft and juicy; I specially like asparagus, while my friend, a Japanese guy specially likes steak, and waguy fried rice. It's perfect after the main course. And FYI, Kirin beer is available here, this is so difficult to find in Thailand.  It's really worth trying experience as Chef is super, food is delicious, staff is attentive. However it is for casual dinning, as it's teppan restaurant so it's sometimes a bit noisy and smelly; price is from 200-300$ for 2 if you don't order Japanese waguy. If you have Citi Bank premium card, you will get 15-30% off depends on the promotion policy of the month.  Here's what you need to know before you go to Nami, and this is also the reason I gave 4* but not 5*. If you are unlucky and you get a bad chef like I did last night, you will have a horrible meal. The girl who served me last night, she was serving another couple besides us when we came, they order Japanese waguy, which is about 200$, she made it totally dried and ugly. It was totally different from what I got when we first came to Nami. I was a bit worried but I tried to stay calm and be nice, which then I found out it's a big mistake.  She cooked my favorite asparagus in low temperature in short time, she didn't cut it nicely for us to eat, the vegetable was totally raw and color still not changed yet, and the worst the it's so old that I couldn't chew nor swollen it. I asked her to cook a bit more and my friend asked for the same. He must have tried to be polite and eat the terrible old raw vegetable at first. Then she cooked it again, still low temperature and put tons of oil on it, she shaped it as a small mountain on the cooking table. After the second cook, the asparagus was so oily, ugly and I still couldn't chew it as it's too old.  Then my second favorite, salmon, she also used low template, cut it so thin, and cooked for so long, it ended up, of course, very dried. The outside was not beautifully burned color as I normally got and inside was totally overcooked. It was also smelly and taste terrible. I really wanted to have good time with my date, but I couldn't handle it any longer, looking at her clumsy skills which are totally different from what I normally saw here. Then when I was so desperate, I saw my favorite chef, coming to the table beside, I called staff to change the chef, and point to my favorite chef at Nami. The restaurant manager then offered me a new chef as my chef just started at another table and it would take her awhile to be available again. I gave it a try.  The new chef was a nice young man, his skills were great and totally different from the clumsy chef I first got. My appetite was spoiled because of the oily asparagus and disaster salmon, but the restaurant offered to serve those dishes again. I refused at first but they insisted to recook a new small piece of salmon, which turned out very good. The rest of the meal was as delicious as normal.  If you are not lucky, getting a bad chef, you better make decision quick, request for a change and rescue your meal.  Best luck.\",\n",

       " \"I regret to say that today's experience at this restaurant has been one of the worst in my life for this kind of high-end meal. The quality of the food has gone downhill, there were insects in vegetables, the seafood were not fresh out like they used to, and to make the matter worse, the chef overcooked some of the them. When we arrived about 5 minutes earlier, we were left standing in front of the door with no access to any seat nor lobby as the staff needed them to used for their own meeting so they locked us out, its not something you would expected for 5 star hotel restaurant and this kind of price. Even worse, when I asked if we could be seated outside the waiting area, the staff pretend to be deaf for a short while, and no apology has been made. This has been one of the worst experience indeed and its a shame for this to happened to this restaurant. I hope they make a speedily improvement as given the amount we have to pay, I don't think the service, and manners (or lack of) and the restaurant itself can last well.\",\n",

       " \"What constitute a great dining experience? Tasty food, customer centric service, enjoyable ambience and the feeling of money well-spent (value). This restaurant has it all!  Food: 9/10 Almost no mistakes. In teppanykai, seasoning is as important as the food texture. They have seasoned the food pretty well. Do try the tofu steak (not in the menu listing). I love the fact that there are lots of mushrooms given which pairs with almost all main courses. The staff recommended me a sake which I thought was quite good too. Note that they charge for ice water. Not that it matter since it's not sold at cut-throat prices (50thb / bottle)  Service: 10/10 The restaurant staff shines brightly in this category. Special shout-out to Ms. Beau. Without her, we probably would have left the restaurant. We came in here highly excited. To our dismay, the seat allocated to us was so warm as the air conditioning is down. Not willing to giving up, Ms Beau tried her best to find us another seat with much better thermal comfort. Another point worth commending: When ordering the food, we probably have ordered quite a bit and was intending to order more. She gave her honest advice that the portion of food would have been sufficient. Indeed it turned out true. (It was our first time, and the menu did not state the amount of Appertisers included in each dish). Our chef (didn't get his name, but shown in the photo), not only dished out our food well, but is fairly entertaining. He engaged us pretty well. Thank you all!  Ambience: 9/10 Great design layout for the teppanykai. Many other teppanykai restaurants have the seating layout of 1chef:8seat layout. In this restaurant, quite a variety of different layout. Some has 1:4 and some 2:8. The tables are also well spaced apart.  Price/value: 8/10 Don't get me wrong, this restaurant is indeed pricey - especially in Bangkok. But considering the freshness of ingredients, generous portions and great ambience in JW Marriott, I would come back a second time! Tips: Marriott Rewards Elite members have some discounts. Do ask!\",\n",
